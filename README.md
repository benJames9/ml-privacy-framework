## Tooling
### Git Conventions
- We'll use conventional commits via the `conventional-commit` pip package, i.e running `gitcommit` to make it
- For branches, we'll eventually have `main` protected, and work primarily on the `develop` branch, branching off of that for `feature` branches and whatnot using [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
